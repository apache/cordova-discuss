### Improving Cordova Documentation
- Status: Completed

For the last few weeks, we have taken measures to get in touch with and understand the experiences of a Cordova user. We put up a survey which received > 900 responses and tried to understand the pain points of working with Cordova. As it was brought up in F2F as well, majority of the users (~100 survey responses) think that the Cordova documentation isn’t up to the mark and is the biggest problem they face. We went through the responses and have summarized them. 

We discussed and came up with few guidelines and possible solutions for these problem areas as mentioned. It would be great if you guys could give feedback, provide better solutions and volunteer for some of these.
